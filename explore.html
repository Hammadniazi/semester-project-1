            As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
            places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
            students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
            laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite
            and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more
            about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students
            through for a visit.

              Come join us at the
              <strong>Community Science Museum</strong> where we’re committed to
              making science accessible to all. Over the course of human
              history, science has developed from our early understanding of
              fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies
              far away to the very building blocks of life itself. The aim of
              our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the
              wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong
              passion to continue the exploration of the world around us. We
              believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
              brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
              different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
              explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact
              with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
              dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when
              everyone’s gone home).
